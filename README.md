## FinBug 

### My Inspiration for this App:

One fine day, when we decided to shift Ahmedabad, Me and Mom were calculating the expenses of daily life there and I realized that budgeting is very important for every individual. That is when I decided to do this app. As a 13 year old, and because of mom, I have grown up as an independent individual. But everybody is not having correct guidance in this aspect, I wanted to help everyone to realize the importance of finance and budgeting in a day to day life. So here is presenting the FinBug it handles the following features.

### Features:
1.	Track your income, and simply see it as a chart for easy analysis on how many side hustles u earn through!!
2.	Track your expenditure, and see what's going wrong with the income.
3.	Mine is unique, as it is user friendly and even a 10 year kid like me can understand the importance of money and become an independent individual. So that we can lead a better tomorrow!
